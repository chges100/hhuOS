 * This is an interface for handling reads from the EEPROM.
 * To control the EEPROM the register EERD mapped to MMIO-space is used.
 *
 * "EERD (00014h; RW)
 *
 *  This register is used by software to cause the Ethernet controller to ready individual words in the
 *  EEPROM. To ready a word, software writes the address to the Read Address field and simultaneously
 *  writes a 1b to the Start Read field. The Ethernet controller reads the word from the EEPROM
 *  and places it in the Read Data field, setting the Read Done filed to 1b. Software can poll this
 *  register, looking for a 1b in the Read Done filed, and then using the value in the Read Data field.
 *
 *  When this register is used to ready a word from the EEPROM, that word is not written to any of
 *  Ethernet controller’s internal registers even if it is normally a hardware accessed word.",
