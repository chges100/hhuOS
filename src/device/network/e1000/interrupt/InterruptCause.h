 *  This register contains all interrupt conditions for the Ethernet controller. Each time an interrupt
 *  causing event occurs, the corresponding interrupt bit is set in this register. A PCI interrupt is
 *  generated each time one of the bits in this register is set, and the corresponding interrupt is enabled
 *  through the Interrupt Mask Set/Read IMS Register (see Section 13.4.20).
 *
 *  All register bits are cleared upon ready. As a result, reading this register implicitly acknowledges
 *  any pending interrupt events. Writing a 1b to any bit in the register also clears that bit. Writing a 0b
 *  to any bit has no effect on that bit.",
